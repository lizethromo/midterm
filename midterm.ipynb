This can be a binary or dichotomous output where the dependent variable has only two output options such as boy and girl, or can be a multi-linear function such as red, blue, yellow. The algorithm used is a predictive algorithm based on previous data that has been recorded and input into the software of the machine in order for it to predict the probability of the outcomes most accurately. \n",

As the image states, the output will be a value between 0 and 1 where the function appears to converge. The function is used to map out a visual representation of the predictions of outputs. What this is based off is is a decision boundary which does exactly what it sounds like. The algorithm finds a threshold in which the youtube will be either 0 or 1. If the output is below or above the threshold, then it will classify the output as one of the two options as previously mentioned girl and boy. An example of a threshold is as follows."
